# Weather Forecast

I created this Weather App with a Search Engine feature and a forecast for the week ahead. Itâ€™s built with HTML, CSS, Vanilla Javascript, Axios and the Openweather & Unsplash API integrations. This project really pushed my limits as this was my first time integrating APIâ€™s with pure Javascript and I was really eager to make the app more complex by adding the image feature, so I had to make sure both apiâ€™s are running perfectly in sync with each other.
